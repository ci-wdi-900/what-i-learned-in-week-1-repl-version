# What I Learned In Week 1 at Code Immersives

### Introduction

This is the second week, but by programmers' count it's Week 1!

You're going to use this project to document what you learned this week. This won't be a simple list of concepts covered, though--you're going to have to dive a little deeper and explain each concept to a layperson. Specifically, you'll explain the concept to yourself from the previous week!

This is a great way to:

* Review the concepts.
* Learn by teaching.
* And practice your content creation skills.


### How Deep You Should Go

You're NOT writing a manual, here. It doesn't have to be as detailed as a cheatsheet! More specifically, you can talk about things in plain English.

Explain it to yourself from before you started this week. That naive student from a week ago--again, you!--didn't have the underlying knowledge to know what HTML or Mark Down are, which means you'll have to explain things GENERALLY, avoiding specific terminology whenever possible.

Don't worry too much about the format overall, though. This is our first time, and we'll converge on a common style for this as we go!


### Tools You'll Practice

* REPL
* Mark Down


### Directions

What did we go through this week? You tell me!

* Create a NEW Replit (HTML/CSS/JS) and add a README.md file
* Use Markdown to explain those concepts!
* Be prepared to present it next week!
